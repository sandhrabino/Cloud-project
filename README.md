## Food-Service microservices deployement

This project was done as part of my Cloud Computing Computing course in S5. 
This is a Online Food delivery service Web Application built on the Express JS platrorm and written in NodeJS and javascript and a little bit of html forthe UI.
The Application Consists of 2 services: 
    - Menu / Welcome Page
    - Order Confirmation / Billing Page
The two microservices communicating with the help of REST API and is deployed on using Kubernetes. 
The Docker files build the respective microservices and in turn the entire application.

To test run the application locally:

```npm build```
```npm start```
